Arthur’s life has taken a turn as he finds himself entangled with Harleen Quinzel, portrayed by Lady Gaga. Unlike the typical portrayal of a romantic interest, Harleen is a force to be reckoned with. She encourages Arthur to embrace his Joker persona while deftly manipulating him. Their relationship is tumultuous and complicated, revealing both the tender and dark sides of love.
